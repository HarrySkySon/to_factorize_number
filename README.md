# to_factorize_number
The Rust program that asks the user to enter a number and then factorizes it using the factorize function

This program uses the io module to read user input from the standard input stream (stdin). It then calls the factorize function with the user input, and prints the resulting prime factors to the console. We've also added some error handling code to ensure that the user enters a valid number.
